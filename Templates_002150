TEMPLATES_002150 User Manages Template Attributes
Use Case ID: TEMPLATES_002150

Description: For creating Templates in the Template Manager, there are two kinds of Templates to choose from: Fragment Templates and Full Templates. Fragment Templates are Templates that represent a piece of content that can be included inside of another Template. A Full Template is a Template that represents the full content of a piece of correspondence, possibly including Fragment Templates. Unlike Full Templates, Fragment Templates cannot become a Letter Instance on their own. Attributes are a set of configuration details and content needed to manage a particular type of correspondence. The purpose of this Use Case is for the user to have the ability to manage the attributes aligned to each Template.
